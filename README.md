# SCN5A (NaV1.5) Variant Functional Perturbation and Clinical Presentation Variants of a Certain Significance
An analysis of the relationship between the penetrance of heart arrhythmias in carriers of SCN5A variants and <i>in silico</i> predictors (e.g. PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2) and functional parameters (e.g. variant-specific peak current, late current, volatages of activation, etc.). All code and data used in the corresponding manuscript (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728395) are included here.
