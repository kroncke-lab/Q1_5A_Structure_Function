# Protein structure aids predicting functional perturbation of missense variants in SCN5A and KCNQ1
An analysis of features to predict the functional consequences of missense variants in the genes SCN5A and KCNQ1. We looked at sequence conservation, <i>in silico</i> variant classifiers, secondary structural elements, and many other structure-derived features. All code and data used in this publication (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828412) are included here.
